          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Alexander Gonzalez and am currently 25 years old living
            in Florida. I decided I wanted to start a better life for myself and
            my family which influnced my decision to get into Software
            development. I started taking classes at my community college and
            almost finished my AA degree in Computer Science however, I had
            learned nothing About the actual field. I wanted to get my hands
            dirty with some actual work and attempted to learn on my own but
            quickly got stuck following tutorials and not being able to do
            anything for myself, that's when I found Lambda and I signed up
            almost immediately.

            >
            <br>
              For our first project they gave us an image and we had to set up
			  a page with HTML and CSS to replicate the image given to us. This project was pretty exciting to do on my own both because it was my first and because
			I was able to start using some of what I had learned to the test and was actually able to succeed which felt amazing for me!</br>

              <p>
					In this project we styled a website to match a photo without being able to use flexbox, the then had us redo this same picture for the second project using Flexbox

              <p>
				In this project we learned how to use Flexbox making displaying our pages much easier than the first time we did it. Lambda wanted us to get a feel for the harder
				way before teaching us Flexbox.

                This project taught us responsive Design, we learned how to change a websites look depending on how small the screen was using Media Queries. This project was probably
			   my favorite we have done so far.

                This is where we take our knowledge from the last 2 weeks and test ourselves on it. This is a 3 hour project we are supposed to do on our own without asking for help
				(except from Google)

				That is the end of my Github projects for now. I eagerly await what else Lambda has in store for me and can not wait to update this website with 
				the future projects to come from working at Lambda School. Thank you for taking the time to look at my portfolio
